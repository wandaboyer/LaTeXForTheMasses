Hi, folks! Welcome to..... ~*_//LaTeX for the Masses\\_*~


Our goal
--------
To seek out new life, and new civili... Oops, wrong script. But really,
the goal of this repository is for us to accumulate some LaTeX documents
that can streamline daily processes and look good doin' it.


Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------
No swears or naughty words.


.... Oh, who am I kidding. As long as your document serves some purpose,
stick it up here with maybe a little README in it's own subdirectory, and
then change the "Current Contents" subsection below :)


Current Contents
----------------
Zip. Zilch. In fact, this is the only thing here. But that, dear reader,
will soon change!
